MLeRP is available to all Australian academic researchers through the [Australian Access Federation (AAF)](https://aaf.edu.au/). AAF is a not for profit organisation that enables access to online resources, like MLeRP, to Australian educators and researchers.

This means that rather than configuring a password to access MLeRP, you will be able to use your organisation's single sign on to access MLeRP. AAF has been integrated with MLeRP's web portal, Strudle as well as the SSOSSH key managment system.
