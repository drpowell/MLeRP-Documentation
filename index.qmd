The MLeRP environment creates a middle ground that has the interactivity of a notebook with the power of a HPC environment that can share valuable resources between other users while code isnâ€™t being executed.

We provide users with CPU based Jupyter notebook sessions capable of basic analysis, with the ability to interactively send jobs to a SLURM queue for GPU or parallelised CPU acceleration through Dask.

Be sure to check out the [Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/), [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) and [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) documentation for more information.

MLeRP at the moment is only available through closed beta but is planned to be available through open beta to all Australian academic researchers through AAF. You can sign up to our mailing list if you'd like us to let you know when we're ready for open beta.
