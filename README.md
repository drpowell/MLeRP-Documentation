# MLeRP Documentation
This repo is to house the documentation for MLeRP. The documentation uses the Quarto framework to render the documentation hosted at `https://docs.mlerp.cloud.edu.au/` using GitHub Pages. The documentation is also published on Confluence in the [`Machine Learning eResearch Platform Knowledge Base`](https://monasheresearch.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MLeRPKB/overview).

The pages are written in quarto markdown for main pages, with iPython notebook tutorials where appropriate.

## Website Publishing
The HTML that is rendered is hosted on the `gh-pages` branch. To render it run:
```
quarto publish gh-pages
```

You can push the changes to the github repo which is located [here](https://github.com/mitchellshargreaves-monash/MLeRP-Documentation).
