MLeRP is split into two regions which users can choose between - one based in Monash (Melbourne, Victoria) and one based in QCIF (Brisbane, Queensland). The clusters have seperate file systems and quotas are provisioned seperately, so you will have to transfer your files across if you'd like to switch regions.

## Monash

Monash workloads are able to make use of the attached NVME on the compute nodes by writing to `/tmp`. These files will remain accessible for the course of your job.

The Monash region is designed to be flexible. It is split into two partitions: `BigCats` and `HouseCats`.

### `BigCats` Partition

#### **CPU notebooks that control Dask workers**
Lion QoS Notebook with Cheetah QoS Workers

Ideal for:

- Data processing
- Rapid and flexible iteration during development
- Experimenting with techniques

Flavours available:

- Tabby
  - 6 VCPUs
  - 56 GB RAM
  - 10 GB VRAM GPU

See our [tutorials](/tutorials/1_dask_slurm.ipynb) for more details and [this FAQ](/faq.qmd#how-much-compute-should-i-ask-for-with-my-slurmcluster) for advice on requesting resources through the Dask scheduler.

#### **Batch submission**
Lion QoS Script

Ideal for:  

- Model training
- Heavy duty processing
- Hyperparameter sweeps

### `HouseCats` Partition

#### **Notebooks with GPU compute**
Tabby QoS Notebook  

Ideal for:  

- Data exploration
- Data visualization
- New users who just want to get started with minimal setup

Flavours available:

- Small Lion
  - 4 VCPUs
  - 16 GB RAM
- Medium Lion
  - 6 VCPUs
  - 32 GB RAM
- Large Lion
  - 6 VCPUs
  - 32 GB RAM



## QCIF
The QCIF region uses a more traditional approach with A100 GPU enabled notebook or terminal sessions. This user experience is much closer to using a service like Google Colab, but with a permanent file system.

GPU notebook or terminal sessions in three sizes:

- Regular
  - 20 VCPUs
  - 190 GB RAM
  - 10 GB VRAM GPU
- Double
  - 20 VCPUs
  - 190 GB RAM
  - 20 GB VRAM GPU
- Node
  - 60 VCPUs
  - 570 GB RAM
  - 2x 10 GB VRAM  GPU + 1x 20 GB VRAM GPU
